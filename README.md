# clj-cera

Clojure port of the Complex Event Recognition Architecture (CERA).

See the following for more information on CERA:
* The main paper describing CERA (PDF): [Multimodal Event Parsing for Intelligent User Interfaces](http://www.entish.org/published/P2338-fitzgerald.pdf)
* Another paper discussing CERA (PDF): [Complex Event Pattern Recognition Software for Multimodal User Interfaces](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aphillips/publications/cera-mics-04.pdf)
* Open-source versions of CERA in Python and C++ at SourceForge.net: [CERA](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cera/)

In the discussion below, I'm assuming the reader has read the first paper above and so understands the gist of CERA and the meaning of signals, patterns and recognizers in this context.

Clj-cera is an exercise in porting the original object-oriented (OO) version of CERA into idiomatic Clojure. It uses a records (via defrecord) for Status and Signal types, a Recognizer protocol, and each recognizer implements this protocol via different defrecord types. The Clojure implementation relies on the polymorphism allowed by the Recognizer protocol. This polymorphism allows the recognizers to be nested together.

The Recognizer protocol defines three methods: `transition`, `recognized` and `contravened?`. The Recognizers of the original CERA code had `signal`, which I renamed to transition to avoid confusion between the signal type and the signal action (noun and verb confusion). My `contravened?` method is the same as the original `is_contravened` and `isContravened` (the Python and C++ names). I've added the `recognized` method, which returns the actual Signals a recognizer has recognized (matched) once it is complete.

Perhaps the largest (and mind-bending) change is that clj-cera's recognizers are immutable. This means the `transition` method returns a new recognizer in its next state after consuming the probe signal. This is in contrast to the original OO implementation's `signal` method, which changes the recognizers internal mutable state, and returns the recognizer's current status.

The Python and C++ use an immutable Pattern class, which is not needed in this Clojure version since recognizers are immutable. So instead of creating a Pattern object and calling make-recognizer, one can simply keep reuse the initial recognizer over and over.

The BaseRecognizer (the bottom-most recognizer that actually matches signals and does not allow deeper nesting) is more generalized than the original OO version, allowing arbitrary predicates for the signal and contravention matching. The CERA paper discusses arbitrary predicates, however the OO code only allows for signals with matching data.
